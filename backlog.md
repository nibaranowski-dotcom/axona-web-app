# Axona Web App — Build Backlog (CPRD-ready)

Source of truth: `specs/axona-build-spec.md`. Brand/tokens: `design.md`. This backlog is the
ordered story list Joe consumes via the **CPRD** trigger. Build order follows spec §9 milestones.

## How to use this with Joe
Paste any row as:

```
CPRD "[position][Epic][Track][StoryID][Title][Priority][Size][Status][Effort][Dependencies]"
```

Example:
```
CPRD "31 E3 Platform ART.1 AgentRuntime — Claude tool-use loop with typed tool registry P0 L todo 5 Needs FND.11, FND.6"
```

Joe emits a full Cursor-ready PRD on the build-spec stack (below). `Effort` is in dev-days.
`Status` starts `todo`; flip to `wip`/`done` as you go.

## Stack decision — build spec wins (reflected against the AI-native operating system scope)

I compared Joe's generic defaults against the Axona build spec for **this** product — a multi-tenant,
agent-orchestrating operating system for robotics with per-unit genealogy, fleet/machine telemetry,
SSE agent traces, and human-gated money/safety/contract actions. The spec stack wins on every axis;
the generic defaults are a starting point, not a frozen contract (per Joe's Precedence rule). Verdict:

| Layer | Joe default | **Axona (chosen)** | Why the spec wins for this scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| ORM/DB | Drizzle + Supabase | **Prisma + PostgreSQL** | §3 data model is already authored as Prisma across 40+ models; rewriting to Drizzle is pure cost. pgvector + FTS + a telemetry table all live in one Postgres. |
| Auth | Clerk | **Auth.js (NextAuth) + RBAC** | Enterprise robotics buyers need SSO/SAML and self-hostability; 7-role RBAC (§8) is org-internal, not Clerk's org model. |
| Background jobs | Inngest | **BullMQ (Redis)** | Workflows are explicit DAGs with decision gates streaming SSE traces (§5); BullMQ gives that control and pairs with the Redis the runtime already needs. |
| AI | Vercel AI SDK | **Claude via thin `AgentRuntime`** | The moat is a tool-use loop with cross-module orchestration + persisted traces (§5). Keep `generateObject`+Zod **as a principle** for any structured agent output. |
| Telemetry | — | **Postgres/Timescale time-series** | Fleet + machine signals need a real time-series store (§3.4/§3.6); Supabase adds nothing here. |
| Files | — | **S3/MinIO + extraction pipeline** | File matrix (§4.8) needs blob storage + text extraction + embeddings. |
| Deploy | Vercel | Vercel/web + worker for BullMQ | Web on Vercel; the agent/workflow worker runs as a long-lived Node process (not serverless). |

**Kept from Joe (engineering principles, stack-agnostic):** `orgId` on every query; mutations only
through server actions / route handlers; `requireRole()` as line 1 of every mutating action; Zod
schemas for all structured AI output with try/catch per AI call; named queue steps + `Promise.allSettled`
fan-out + idempotent inserts; field-approval governance (`approved_by`/`approved_at`, agents see only
approved data); a verify script + `docs/manual-checks.md` entry + clean `tsc --noEmit` per story.

**Design tokens:** Joe's near-black/electric-teal defaults are **overridden** by `design.md` — Archivo +
JetBrains Mono, paper/panel/ink surfaces, single lime `#c6f24f` signal, functional green for live/approved,
hairlines over shadows, no emoji, no invented reds (critical = ink). Light field, **not** dark-mode-first.

**Billing scope note:** the **Finance module (E8 / FIN.\*)** is a *product feature* — the robotics
customer's own P&L, invoices, unit economics. The **Billing epic (E10 / BILL.\*)** is *Axona-as-SaaS*
billing the tenant for seats/usage. They are different surfaces and must not be conflated.

## Architecture: four layers over one spine (see `specs/architecture-learnings.md`)

The product is four layers over one spine. Only **L2 compounds** — it is the moat; the rest are
competitive necessities buildable by anyone with engineers. Resourcing and care follow that asymmetry.

| Layer | What it is | In this backlog |
|---|---|---|
| **L4 — Vertical editions** | Humanoid · Mobility · Healthcare packaging | GTM surface, post-MVP |
| **L3 — Domain apps** | Procurement, Quality, Maintenance, Delivery, … (the 24 modules) | **E5–E8** |
| **L2 — Intelligence spine** | Specialized models · operational memory · agent runtime · learning loop | **E3 + E13 (THE MOAT)** |
| **L1 — Foundation** | Connectors · ontology · per-unit genealogy · immutable event log · data plane | **E0 + E12** |

**Two build sequences, reconciled.** E0–E11 are screen-first (spec §9) so the prototype/demo is
coherent fast. The *moat* sequence (learnings §11) is capture → memory → runtime+guardrails →
procurement wedge → **close the learning loop**. The reconciliation, and the single most important
engineering instruction in this repo:

> **Build the load-bearing capture in its correct shape from day one — even while the learning loop
> is stubbed.** Per-unit genealogy must be captured *as-built* (not reconstructed), telemetry is a
> first-class typed input (not an afterthought), and every agent action logs *model · confidence ·
> approver* into an immutable event log. Capture fidelity at L1 caps model quality at L2; retrofitting
> it later is the top risk (§12) and silently kills the moat. So `MFG.1` (genealogy), `FLEET.1`/`MACH.1`
> (telemetry), `AUDIT.1` (event log), and `ART.5` (trace) are **moat-load-bearing** — hold them to a
> higher bar than their P-level implies, and shape them per E12/E13/E14 even before those epics land.

**Feeds-the-loop test.** Score every new story on whether it feeds `data → memory → models → better
proposals → outcomes → data`. If it doesn't touch the loop, it's table stakes, not moat — fine to
build, but don't let it crowd out spine work.

**Wedge.** Procurement (`PROC.*`) is the first domain co-pilot — warmest access, most painful job
(long-lead sourcing + BOM churn + genealogy). Treat it as the proving ground for the spine, not just
another module.

## E13 — Intelligence Spine (L2 · THE MOAT) · Track: Moat · L2

> Research-grade portfolio (learnings §7), not a single "agent feature." Each line carries its own eval
> metric. `ART.*` (E3) is the runtime; this epic is the memory, confidence, trust, and learning loop
> that make it compound. LOOP/SLM are post-wedge bets — defensibility begins when LOOP.\* closes.

## Totals & sequencing notes
- **131 stories** across 15 epics. P0 = MVP spine; P1 = complete the set; P2 = harden/monetize/research.
- **Moat layer (E12–E14)** is the part that keeps Axona *product, not services*. Build it in the
  learnings §11 order — L1 capture → memory → runtime+guardrails → procurement wedge → **close the loop**
  — and remember a plan that stops at "we shipped a procurement co-pilot" has built a feature, not the
  moat. Protect the runway to `LOOP.*`.
- **113 original stories** across 12 epics. P0 = MVP spine; P1 = complete the set; P2 = harden/monetize.
- Foundation (E0) and the agent runtime (E3) gate almost everything — build them first, exactly per
  spec §9 milestones (DB+seed → shell+Mission Control+Search → AgentRuntime+Agents+chat → Command
  Center → Projects/matrix → Workflows+engine → Machines → value-chain → robotics → back-office →
  RBAC+audit+guardrails). RBAC/audit (E2) is threaded early because every mutation needs it.
- Each module follows the same triad — **data/API → screen → agents** — so they parallelize across
  developers once E0–E4 land.
- `EMAIL.1` is pulled to P0 because AUTH.5/AUTH.7 depend on it.
- Every story's PRD (via CPRD) ships a verify script, a `docs/manual-checks.md` entry, agent trace
  where relevant, human-in-the-loop on gated actions, RBAC + org scoping, v2 tokens only, clean tsc.
